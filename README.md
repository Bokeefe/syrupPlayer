This is my first real REact.js project

I drafted what I want to do in regular JS in a another repo and now I am figuring out how to connect everything react.js style.  The end goal being a music player that only plays music slowly with reverb. 


Why you ask?
In the vein of DJ Screw, Caretaker, Bohren and der Club of Gore, I love slow music lately. A lot of regular bad music sounds awesome slowed down. Ever heard Kenny G at half speed? You will be able to here.
